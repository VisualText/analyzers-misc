EXPERIENCE
Research Assistant, 9/97-present
University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 
o	Research on natural language processing, focused on information extraction and retrieval, vagueness. Working on Unix(Solaris 2.5), Linux, GNU C/C++, perl, lisp, matlab, gnuplot, python.
Software Engineer, 1/97-2/97 
Bluesea Computer Corp., Wenzhou, China
Patent Information Search 
o	The project is to enable user to query Chinese patent information via WWW. The data is not several kinds of databases, MS SQL server, Foxbase, Access. I designed a prototype of search engine, using perl, ODBC on IIS.
Research Assistant, 1/96-6/97 
China State Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and System, Beijing, China
