             What I Can Do for You

            I am a user-centered software designer / architect, which
            means that I design large and small software systems to fit
            the needs of real human beings. The usability of a product
            comes first, the internal architecture comes second.

            I am not seeking a full time position at this time. However,
            consulting inquiries are fine.

            I have put together a list of books I would recommend to
            anyone interested in learning more about user interface
            design.
