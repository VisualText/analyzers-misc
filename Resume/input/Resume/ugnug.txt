WORK EXPERIENCE

TRW Space & Defense, Redondo Beach, CA.  Open-Source Intelligence Technologies.  Senior Engr/Scientist.  Sep 93-present.

Responsible for automated document processing, information extraction, and system integration in an end-to-end open-source processing, storage, and dissemination IR&D project (InfoWeb).  Designed and implemented a new Deft text analysis system and Swift profiling system.   Developed and maintained TRW's Core DEFT software system and co-developed applications.  Assisted in developing a natural language processing (NLP) parser for DEFT.  Helped develop applications for TRW internal and external customers.  Participated in $10M win of a Digital Library System contract from a major Southern California news organization.  Contributed to proposals, presentations, and demonstrations. Converted InfoWeb subsystems from C to C++ and enhanced the Java client GUI.  Installed, administered, and built Informix/Illustra databases on Sparc Ultra.

McDonnell Douglas Defense & Electronic Systems Company, Santa Ana, California and Huntington Beach, California.  Advanced Software Technologies Lab.  Senior Engineer/Scientist.  Dec 87-Sep 93.

Conducted artificial intelligence (AI) system development, co-creating TexUS (Text Understanding System). (Sparcstation, C) and extending the VOX (Vocabulary Extension) system and approach (Symbolics, Common Lisp).  Co-led a corporate project for NLP and speech understanding.  Led R&D projects and tasks in military intelligence processing and intelligent human machine interfaces.  Integrated message analysis and expert system-based situation assessment.  Supported SEI Level III self-assessment.  Participated in proposals, presentations, and demonstrations.

UC Irvine, AI Project, Dept. of Information and Computer Science.  Programmer/Analyst III.  Jul 82-Dec 87.

Developed AI systems and theories in NLP, knowledge representation, and knowledge acquisition. 1983-1987. Designed and implemented the VOX NLP system.  Created the Conceptual Grammar knowledge representation framework.  Oversaw message processing contract with DARPA and Naval Ocean Systems Center (NOSC, in San Diego) (Decsystem2020, UCI-MLISP and Symbolics, Zetalisp).  Converted the World Modeling System (CMU) to use UNIX 4.2 interprocess communication (Integrated Solutions, UNIX, C). 1982-1983 Maintained the NOMAD Navy message processing system under contract to NOSC (Decsystem2020, UCI-MLISP). Designed and implemented PSYCHO, a system for real-time testing of human inferencing during reading (Apple, Basic).

UC Berkeley, Dept. of Computer Science.  Research Assistant.  Sep 79-Jun 82.

1980-1982 Co-implemented PLAIN compiler and run-time system (VAX, C).
1979 Co-implemented threaded-code APL compiler (VAX, Fortran).
