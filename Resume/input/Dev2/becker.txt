Selected Career Highlights
--------------------------

  *  Expert in Windows and Unix programming with C, C++, and Perl:

     ** 4 years of Microsoft Windows development experience (3.11, 95, and
        NT), C and C++, the Win32 API, Visual C++ and MFC, as well as Perl
        for Win32.

     ** Over 10 years professional Unix programming experience (BSD, SunOS,
        Solaris, HP-UX), C and C++, C- and Korn shell programming, awk, sed,
        lex, yacc, and the whole range of Unix commands.

     ** Over 4 years programming Perl, including a fully-featured Perl/CGI
        bug-tracking database application on Win32 and an Perl/CGI E-commerce
        application using SQL Server, Microsoft IIS, CyberCash, and
        public-key encryption tools.

     ** Began programming in C in 1982, C++ and Perl in 1992. Taught
        university-level courses in Unix and C.

  *  Designed and implemented dozens of stand-alone Windows and Unix
     applications (windowed and console apps), as well as several types of
     DLLs (USRDLLs, AFXDLLs, and MFC "Extension DLLs") and Unix shared
     libraries.

  *  Developed a variety of network applications: intranet applications with
     Perl/CGI, distributed systems in C using remote procedure calls (RPC's)
     and sockets, a remote Ingres database and embedded SQL, and a
     near-real-time control/data acquisition system using Tcl network
     protocols.

  *  Leveraged object-oriented development methods and mechanisms to their
     utmost, including data hiding and encapsulation, single- and
     multiple-inheritance, polymorphism, etc.

  *  Professionally experienced with Ingres, SQL, Embedded SQL (in C). Trained
     in relational database theory (foundations, design, normalization,
     etc.), SQL, and Oracle internal architecture.

  *  Experienced and extensively trained in systems of communicating,
     sequential processes (e.g., threads, parallel processes, etc.), process
     communication mechanisms (remote procedure calls, sockets, etc.), and
     synchronization techniques.
