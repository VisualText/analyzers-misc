     evaluations.
     Design and implementation of a file transfer utility for data exchange
     between UNIX, DEC/Alpha and Oracle table via AF/Frame application.
     Utility had bookmark and logging feature to facilitate repetitive data
     transfers and audit trails. Used SAS/CONNECT and FTP for data transfer
     routines. Application developed using SAS 6.12 on DEC/Alpha in an
     X-Windows environment for easy to use GUI.

3/7/97 - 5/17/97
Contract Programmer/Analyst at Charles Schwab, San Francisco ,CA

     Development of SAS utility programs to analyze and report on WWW
     server performance. Netscape logs and server performance data reside
     in multiple environments, MVS/TSO and UNIX and is formatted and loaded
     into SAS datasets for analysis. Programs utilize SAS/GRAPH,
     SAS/INSIGHT and various tabulate and report processes. SAS/CONNECT
     used to access data on MVS from UNIX. Web development tools. Output
     reports are formatted as HTML documents and made available for
     intranet access. Mainframe data is accessed via SAS/CONNECT, using
     Telnet and TCP/IP protocols from a Sun Solaris UNIX platform.

5/8/95-2/7/97 : Contract Programmer - Pacific Bell, San Ramon, CA

     Development of enhancements to the Work Tracking System. Primarily a
     SAS/AF application which interfaces with MULTITRAK VSAM files to
     accommodate a menu driven batch reporting system. Includes interactive
     time reporting features.
     Utilizes SAS/SHARE, SAS/AF, SCL, extensive use of extended tables and
     macros.
     Complexities of the system involve:
        o Multiple daily extracts from VSAM files to mirrored GDG SAS disk
          volumes.
        o Utilization of SAS/SHARE to accommodate simultaneous access to
          work management and timecard data.
        o Automated downloads of user driven extracts to Excel spreadsheets
          via FTP from mainframe to LAN.
        o E-mail notifications to users utilizes hypertext to invoke helper
          applications via NETSCAPE browsers.
        o Ongoing performance enhancements utilizing indexes, data
          partitioning/archiving and SAS/SHARE.
        o Report distribution formats reports in Rich Text Format and
          utilizes internet e-mail ids for report distribution.
        o Complex macros to facilitate parameter driven report generation
          and standardized data validation.
