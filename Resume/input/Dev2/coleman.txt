          RESEARCH ENGINEER
          January 1995 to Present

               Worked in the Instrument Development Lab of the
               Center on Human Development and Disability performing
               engineering activities to support behavioral and
               biomedical research.

               Working under a grant from the NIH, successfully
               developed and implemented software for testing the
               affects of trace level toxicity on neural functions.
               This software consisted of functions ranging from
               real time testing to post acquisition data analysis.
               Developed a software driven automated calibration
               system that reduced instrument calibration time for
               the above study by a factor of over ten while
               increasing testing precision and coverage by a
               significant amount.

               Developed a Windows based program to assess early
               childhood visual recognition and memory. Developed
               hardware, software and documentation for research
               projects in the fields of audiology and cognitive and
               sensory recognition. Gained experience in developing
               assistive devices for people with physical and mental
               disabilities.

 AlliedSignal formerly Sundstrand Data Control

 SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER
 January 1991 to October 1994

      Worked as a senior software engineer on the MK-V and Enhanced
      Ground Proximity and Windshear Detection Computer. Led
      development on a new database driven mode of operation
      (Terrain Clearance Floor) for the Ground Proximity Detection
      Computer. Successfully developed implemented and test flew PC
      based prototype that demonstrated this mode and other new
      concepts. Successfully led two large scale projects from
      inception through to FAA certification. Developed and
      implemented a communications interface and menuing system to
      make the MK-V warning computer compatible with the Airbus
      Centralized Fault Display System. Gained experience in
      designing and debugging real time embedded and PC based "C"
      and "C++" code.

      Ground Proximity and Wind Shear Detection Computer. Designed
      Software and performed Software testing. Designed automated
      software testing tools on VAX based facilities. Developed an
      automated test bed environment which became the basis for
      AlliedSignal's module based software verification tests.
      Gained experience in designing, documenting, testing and
      validating system software requiring FAA software approval to
      specification RTCA/DO-178A,ESSENTIAL, LEVEL 2. Designed and
      implemented software for 2 of 8 modes of operation for the
      MK-VII Military Ground Proximity Computer.
