Personal Profile:

I have gained development experience through using Microsoft Access within
my academic and commercial experience. I have in-depth knowledge of
developing applications with Access supported by advanced functionality.  I
consolidated this recently, by attending a Microsoft Access Consultancy
course. I have used Access from version 2.0 through to 97 and would class
it as my major skill. My contract work has enabled me to develop skills
such as Project Management

I have also gained experience in the area of HTML development and been able
to build this through mainly my academic and also professional work. I have
also gained skills in other web related areas such as Java, Active Server
Pages and VRML.

I have completed a BTEC Professional Development Course in ‘C’ programming
which has given me advanced programming skills in the language. I acheived
marks of 93% and 96% respectively in thetwo assignments given. I am now
studying courses in C++ and Visual Basic

Work Experience:

February 1999 - June 1999
MS Access/Visual Basic Developer
Milton Keynes Council, IT Division,Milton Keyenes, Buckinghamshire

I was brought in to extend a partially developedMicrosoft Access '97
database for the Music Service. With little or no documentationI was
required to assess the functionality that had been completed and to
completedevelopment of the system. A detailed systems specification has
since been documented andextensive additional features have been added,
including error handling and query optimisation.In addition I developed
someVisual Basic front ends for the database to enhance it.
Following completion of this I will then be looking at a range of in house
database applicationsand extending and completing their development.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Work Experience:

October 1998 - January 1999
MS Access/SQL Server
Henderson AMP, Moorgate , London

I was brought in to assess the implications of introduction of the Euro on
in-house critical systems built in Microsoft Access. I carried out a
detailed analysis of systems containing information that included details
about equities, futures, bonds etc.

I liased with users of various systems and built up a functional
specification for each system. This was needed, as there was no existing
documentation for the systems and they would be looked at further in a
future Y2K project.

A detailed conversion programmed for these systems was then developed and I
also helped to develop a Risk Map/Strategy for the EMU review project. I
also wrote a system to correct and format invalid Euro test data. I gained
a basic working knowledge if SQL server through analysing a complex
database written in it.

I gained a good insight into a range of different programming techniques
and styles in addition to enhancing current project management skills.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

January 1998 - August 1998
MS Access Consultant
Ericsson, Horsham, West Sussex

I was brought in initially to develop a specific financial modelling
application and since then have produced several different Management
Reporting Tools.

I have also been heavily involved in advising and managing the
re-development of an in-house order system written in Microsoft Access '97
that I co-administered.

I created customised Lotus Notes views as the source data that this
application imported. I was also involved in the design and implementation
of a Project Reporting Tool that is used by Managers. This tool used
advanced reports fed by multiple data sources of data imported in from
Notes, MS Excel etc.

I also used Visual Basic 5 to create some example GUI’s to act as the front
end for various applications built in Access. I also used Crystal Reports
linked directly to an Oracle database.

I created specific Compact/Repair routines for the front end of an in-house
database application. These functions had to be set to run automatically
and I helped our technical support to write a scheduled Windows NT routine
to do this. I also produced user documentation for various applications in
addition to defining system administration procedures for applications.

I gained knowledge of Active Server Pages when asked to re-engineer an ASP
web front-end link to an Access database running on a local web server. In
addition I was able to look at some of the workings of ODBC. Most recently
I have been writing web pages using MS Front Page  linked directly to
Oracle data sources.

Overall I have been able to extend my knowledge of MS Access including
rounding off applications and learn more and more of the intricacies of the
powerful programming language that belies the application. This amongst
other work that I have done has quite advanced my detailed knowledge of
Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).  I have also gained strong project
development experience, strong communications skills with different levels
and been able to work effectively in a team. I have also gained good
financial and business knowledge of a telecommunications business.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

October - November 1997
IT Contractor
General Electric, Sunbury-On-Thames

I was brought in at very short notice, to ascertain the feasibility of
developing an off-line application. The system specification was that it
would allow users to enter/review tonnage data and generate a flat file in
a pre-determined valid format.

Following the feasibility stage, a custom application was developed in
Microsoft Access '97 providing full validation, error handling and dialog
functions.

The requirements provided by the client for this system were completed in
half the time allocated for this project. In the remaining time, further
enhancements were made to the system as requested by the user. Additional
features of a typical application such as start-up screen, custom short-cut
menus, pop-up forms were also provided.

During this project my DAO programming skills in  MS Access were enhanced.
I also improved other skills such as Systems Analysis, HCI (Human Computer
Interaction) principles and Rapid Prototyping.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

August 1994 - July 1995
IT Placement Student
(3rd Year of BSc Computer Science sandwich degree)
Nestle UK, York

I developed applications in Microsoft Access in connection with training
users to move to using Microsoft Office from DOS based products. Amongst
many applications that I developed, I created a custom application in
Access for Personnel. This system reported details about NVQ trainees and
was converted from a system written in DataEase.

The application included additional features such as form driven reporting,
custom menu and toolbars, full security and mail merge of data to Microsoft
Word. A menu driven structure with a customised start-up screen linked all
these functions. Advanced access programming techniques were employed in
all aspects of this application, ensuring full error trapping for complete
robustness.

I also gained quite heavy experience in writing Oracle scripts within
PL/SQL. This was a part of a team working on a project recording and
reporting details of all outlets whom stocked Nestle Rowntree products and
was held on a production and test database.

I also trained users in applications developed in Powerbuilder. I worked in
various parts of the company including Finance, Sales, Marketing Research,
Personnel and this was my first job with IT experience and it gave me
invaluable experience in different parts of a commercial business such as
Nestle Rowntree. I have been able to vastly improve skills such as team
working and interpersonal skills. My planning and organisational skills
have also improved.
