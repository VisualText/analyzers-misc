Personal Interests

Flying airplanes
     I have enjoyed flying ever since my first flight with my parents in a
     Piper Cherokee 25 years ago. I received my private pilots license on
     September 16th, 1993 and have flown approximately 130 hours. I am
     currently checked-out in the Cessna 172 and Piper Warrior. I am
     currently working towards an Instrument/Commercial rating.
     Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association

Downhill skiing
     I learned to ski at a very young age -- I don't remember a time when I
     didn't know how to ski. I was on the Cadillac Ski Team; Junior Varsity
     for a year and Varsity for 3 years.
     XVIII Olympic Winter Games

Pool
     I started playing pool at age 12. I currently play regularly in
     tournaments and I am a member of the American Pool Association with a
     7 handicap in 9-ball.

Chess
     I learned to play chess quite young, but the game didn't really
     interest me until High School where I began to play in National
     tournaments. I currently hold a US Chess Federation rating of 1724
     (Class B).
