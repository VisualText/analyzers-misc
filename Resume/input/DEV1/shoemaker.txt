Career Experience:

     Currently developing a multi-tier client server application for a
     national life insurance company. By adhering to strict object oriented
     methodologies we have reduced application rigidity and increased
     maintainability. Standard design patterns have allowed us to abstract
     3rd party libraries into interfaces, therefore making our software
     more extendable.

     Worked as a software developer and data modeler on one of the largest
     corporate-wide SAP implementations. Performed legacy data analysis
     along with mapping legacy data types into valid SAP structures.
     Validated all data prior to loading it into SAP by writing scripts in
     PL/SQL that cross-referenced proprietary ERD level data. Developed a
     multi-user two-tier data entry application in Microsoft Visual Basic
     5.0 that allowed users to enter equipment, equipment long text,
     equipment technical classes, and the corresponding technical class
     characteristics. The equipment data entry software was written using
     standard ODBC direct communication with Oracle 7.3/8.0 databases for
     sites located in the United States and DAO 3.5 for remote sites that
     did not have a viable network link.

   * 12/92-12/97, MIS Coordinator with Saint Louis University Hospital,
     Healthline
     Developed many dynamic ad hoc reports using a proprietary reporting
     tool on a Pick database. Also, wrote many system housekeeping

     duties on Novell 4.11 file server and on a HP-UX application server.
     Supported 30 users that were spread throughout six remote locations.
     Analyzed and recommended all software/hardware purchases.
