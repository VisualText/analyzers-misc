EXPERIENCE:

"Consulting Company" - Chicago, IL *

01/1999 - present Project Leader

While still working on my previous project I'm leading internet application
project. The TruckTracking application will provide data flow and data
modification for Vehicle Tracking business purposes, will be integrated
with Geographic Positioning System, Mapping, Mobile devices, Wireless
networks and Internet communication channels. Application will provide
persistence of received and send information, transformation and reporting
on this information, integrate mapping information and be configurable.
Primary implementation technologies will involve Microsoft BackOffice,
Internet Explorer and Inprise Delphi.
Application integrate wireless networks middleware and mapping data
components. Message flow will be implemented using clearly defined message
format and data will be transformed using clearly defined business rules.
The TruckTracking Host will serve data as a Web Server and will be capable
to run both in Internet and Intranet scenario. The host will require
external (WAN) connection in both cases to interface with wireless
networks. Such implementation solution solves maintainability requirement
by requiring that the only software installed on client will be standard
Internet browser.
For this project I'm doing project management, design, R&D, SQL server data
design, DHTML custom solutions, SQL Server programming, Middleware
integration, Delphi programming and Communications.
