             + Presented at LotusSphere '96, the Apple WWDC '96, and at a
               Lotus Architect's Class about the Notes/MacOS/Newton
               technology that I developed. The speaker notes for this
               presentation were at one time available at the Lotus web
               site, and were the basis of an article that I wrote for the
               September 1996 issue of MacTech Magazine
             + [Image][Image][Image]
        o Gutenberg Systems, Inc. (for JVC Information Products), Andover,
          Mass.
             + 3/94 to 4/95
             + Developed major upgrade to both Archiver and RomMaker
               (developed during 12/92 to 3/93 contract). New features
               included support of the Drag and Drop Manager (allowing user
               to drag items from the Finder directly to positions in the
               application window). Programs were developed on the
               Macintosh using AppMaker and Symantec Think C++ with the
               Think Class Library.
             + [Image][Image]
        o Digital Equipment Corporation, Nashua, New Hampshire
             + 1/94 to 3/94
             + Macintosh TeamLinks: Helped implement automated test suites,
               developed manual testing scenarios, and did manual testing
               (over 200 bugs reported). Worked with the same QA and
               Engineering groups that I worked with as a programmer from
               3/93 to 6/93.
             + [Image][Image]
        o Scientific American Magazine, New York, NY
             + 6/93 to 2/94
             + Implemented self-paced tutorial program called DISCOTEST II
               for use by medical doctors. Developed for Macintosh, MS
               Windows 3.1, and MS DOS (both text and graphics modes),
               using cross platform shared code. An authoring program is
               used to create and compile the more than 100 script files
               written by Scientific American staff. In compiled form, the
               scripts are platform independent files which provide test
               content and program flow control to all three applications.
             + Mac programs were implemented using Think C++ (TCL) and
               AppMaker. The PC versions were implemented using Microsoft
               Visual C++ and Zinc Application Framework. The PC versions
               shared about 95% of their code with each other. The bulk of
               the source code that I wrote (not including operating
               specfic specific functions) was shared between the Mac and
               PC versions, making about 50% of the product's source code
               platform independent. The script and all data files are 100%
               platform independent.
             + User interface tasks included implementation of multi-line
               checkboxes that are displayed within a scrolling list. The
               list is resized when its window is resized, causing the
               multi-line checkboxes to word wrap to the new size of their
               enclosure.

        o Digital Equipment Corporation, Nashua, New Hampshire
             + 3/93 to 6/93
             + Worked on Macintosh TeamLinks, a forms based groupware
               product that supports Macintosh, MS DOS, MS Windows, and
               VMS. Responsibilities included programming the Macintosh
               external file system, which provides TeamLinks and Finder
               access to VMS file servers. When I started the project, a
               prototype of the external file system already existed. My
               main task was to improve performance (accomplished more than
               50% in some areas), implement some remaining features, and
               fix bugs.
        o Gutenberg Systems, Inc. (for JVC Information Products), Andover,
          Mass.
             + 12/92 to 3/93
             + Developed two Macintosh based CD-ROM mastering systems using
               AppMaker and Think C (TCL). The Personal Archiver, a low-end
               system, was mentioned in the January 15, 1993 issue of
               MacWeek. The Personal RomMaker, is a high end system that
               produces both data and audio CDs. The data CDs can be made
               using HFS, ISO 9660, and Hi Sierra formats, so can be used
               by Macintosh, PC, and UNIX systems. The Personal RomMaker
               was given an "Award of Merit" in the 1993 year end awards
               issue (1/94) of Byte.
        o Lotus Development Corporation, Cambridge, Mass.
             + 5/92 to 12/92
             + Japanese version of 123/Macintosh: Wrote new code and ported
               code from the Windows and UNIX/VMS versions of 123. Wrote a
               40 page document detailing what code was ported and why.
               Areas of coding included reading and writing of Japanese
               file formats, conversion to multibyte character sets, and
               implementation of new "@functions".

        o I have developed a number of public domain programs that are
          available for downloading from my web site, and are also
          available from a number of other web sites.
        o HTML Printer
             + MacOS printer driver to convert a document to HTML. Supports
               text styles & sizes, links to anchors and other files, and
               display of image files. Over 125 copies downloaded from my
               site.
        o ToddlerKeys & ToddlerMouse
             + I designed a few programs for small children who haven't
               quite mastered the concept of using the mouse. These
               programs are currently available only for MacOS, but I'm
               planning on writing Windows and Java versions.
                  + ToddlerMouse consists of one large window containing
                    the letters A to Z and the numbers 0 to 9. When the
                    arrow is moved over a letter or number, that letter or
                    number is flashed in different colors and then "spoken"
                    using my digitized voice. Over 800 copies downloaded
