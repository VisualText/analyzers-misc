Work Experience

     Senior Software Engineer, Seagull Scientific Systems, July 1995 to
     present

          Successfully designed and implemented the Bar Tender: a large
          scale commercial bar code label printing software package running
          on Windows NT and 95. The Bar Tender was developed on Windows
          NT/95 and required in-depth use of object oriented design, C++,
          and MFC. Key technologies implemented were a graphical object
          editor that allowed for the manipulation of graphical objects on
          the screen, comprehensive Undo/Redo design, document/view
          architecture, strict WYSIWYG bar code drawing/printing, and
          processing input data from a variety of sources (e.g. ODBC).
          Tools used were Visual C++, SourceSafe, and BoundsChecker.
          Project duration: 1 year.

          Performed printer driver development for Windows 95/3.1 for
          industry standard thermal printers (Intermec, Datamax, Zeba,
          SATO). Successfully implemented bar code fonts, image
          compression, and 2D bar code symbologies.

          Successfully implemented complex data compression and error
          correction technologies for the drawing and printing of 2D bar
          code symbologies (e.g. PDF417).

     Senior Software Engineer, The Boeing Company, June 1991 to July 1995

          Designed and implemented customer driven user interfaces and
          libraries for real time airplane simulation systems in a Unix
          environment using C++, OSF/Motif, and X-Windows. Successfully
          completed development of a simulation hardware I/O interface,
          language sensitive text editor, and a simulation development
          system.

     Software Engineer, The Boeing Company, June 1986 to June 1991

          Designed and developed real time simulation test environments for
          testing avionic modules using C and FORTRAN. Emphasized control
          system modeling, detailed test procedure implementation, and
          hardware/software problem solving. Developed, documented, and
          maintained application software tools to aid in the development
