     System(EMS) for the corporate's nationwide SONET networks.
     Responbilities include system architecture design and review, and
     TL-1 adapters for SONET Add/Drop multiplexers from various
     vendors.

     The design uses the state-of-the-art technologies in network
     management in telecom industry. I will represent the company to
     have a demo in the upcoming TeleManagement World/NMF Expo in
     Hamburg, Germany this April.

     01/1998 to present
     Part-time Adjunct Faculty
     Southeastern University, Washington DC.

     Teaching a graduate CS course on Java programming.

     01/1998 to 06/1998
     Consultant, Senior Software Engineer
     Orbcomm.
     Helped developed an NMS system for a X.400-based satellite
     messaging system. Responsibilities included problem analysis,
     drafting functional specifications, design and coding, and test
     plan documentation.

        * Analyzed the existing message software, designed and
          developed event filtering for the system. Conducted HP
          OpenView event configurations.
        * Designed a X/MOTIF graphical command interface for the NMS
          system using UIM/X with XRT/Gear toolkit. Sudo is used for
          security management. This utility frees operators from using
          Unix shell to achieve daily duties. Commands are
          configurable and are displayed as a tree view. Command and
          response history are stored using GDBM.
        * Change a satellite calculation program into agent. Designed
          a new MIB for the managed information, and use BMC SNMP
          Toolkit to develop a subagent.

     03/96 to 01/98
     Software Engineer
     Bell Atlantic - Advanced Network System, Silver Spring, MD.
     Designed and implemented a distributed, object-oriented Data
     Network Management System(DNMS). This system is responsible for
     handling inventory, trouble ticketing, and proactive alarm
     management for Bell Atlantic's data networks, including ATM,
     COLAN, FDDI, FNS, Frame Relay, PDN, and SMDS services. A near
     CORBA compliant tool OSP(Object Service Package) is used.

        * Designed and coded the inventory systems in DNMS.
        * Developed performance-monitoring API for alarm processing.
        * Developed a set C++ classes and functions as the OSP API's
          enhancement, including SQL support, bulk operations
          enhancement, automated cross-reference updating, and
          improved functions of object and object list.
        * Developed an MIB loader (with perl5 and OSP's tclcli API) to
          parse MIB files and automatically generate data in DNMS
          mediation subsystem.
        * Designed and coded DNMS provisioning gateway to
          Ascend(Cascade) NMS provisioning server using its C++ API.
        * (8/4/97-9/2/97) Worked with Sun and PSW consultants in BOLD
          performance team to solve BOLD performance problems.
