WORK EXPERIENCE: 

ISADRA Inc., Palo Alto, California (Acquired by VERTICALNET as of May, 24) 
January 1997 - Present, 
Working on design/development of Catsmart Shopper/Business which is a scaleable online database driven catalog
design and operation software, Working on design/development of ERConnect which is Java-based server approach
that access legacy systems (Prophet21, CICS, SAP/R3) over web at real-time such as real-time pricing avaiability or
real-time ordering , worked and still supporting Catsmart Cooperative Commerce which is Java-based agent
approach that integrates e-commerce services. Check out illustration of e-commerce services integration using
Catsmart Cooperative Commerce product. Also worked on design/development of JMerchant which is a pure Java
version of Catsmart Shopper/Busines that runs as servlets with most servers. Such as Java Server, Netscape
Enterprise Server and Apachi server. Projects are related to Internet, Commerce, Online Shoping, Intelligent Agents,
ACL, Artificial Intelligence, KQML, KIF, Distributed information retrieval, Parametric search, Client / Server
programming, Dynamic web page generating, Wrapper/Spider for information extraction from web sites. Using C++,
Java, JDBC, Java Server and Servlets. 

LOCKHEED MARTIN, Palo Alto, California 
December 1992 - January 1997, Worked at various Lockheed Martin locations. 

     Advanced Technology Center, Palo Alto California 
     Senior Software Engineer, Worked on Java Map Server project. Implemented JAVA application that
     generates and displays 2D military maps. Worked in Modeling and Simulation area. Supported the
     development of Exercise Manager software which is a tool for managing military simulation and training devices
     (Flight Simulator, etc) across a network using Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) protocol. Used Object
     Oriented approach and C++/UNIX for implementations. Implemented software that prepares low level packets
     to be broadcast to other simulators on the network. Also supported Airborne Laser project which is the
     defense for 21st century. Written C programs to integrate device drivers to manage the dynamically adjustable
     mirror subsystem. 

     Information Systems Division, Visual Systems, Orlando, Florida 
     Software Design Engineer, Supported the development and maintenance of 3D Visual Data Base Generation
     System Software. This software generates Object Oriented 3D visual database that contains microcode. This
     3D database of world is used by realtime Image Generators and 3D graphics accelerators. Worked on all
     phases of Object Oriented software design and development cycle. Worked on microcoding for Real3D,
     SEGA Model 3 board, Compu-Scene(SE, C6, PT2000) 3D graphics hardwares. Also worked on Digital
     Radar Landmass Simulator project, Written C/C++/UNIX programs. Most of the applications were Flight
     Simulators and 3D games. 

     Simulation and Automated Systems, Daytona Beach, Florida 
     Software Design Engineer, Supported the development and maintenance of real-time 3D Visual Data Base
     Loading software. This software loads micro-code from database to Image Generators in realtime. Written
     C/UNIX programs.

July 1990 - December 92, Worked at various institutes. 

     Intelligent Simulation and Training Systems Laboratory, Orlando, Florida 
     Research Assistant, Implemented Air Traffic Control (ATC) Radar Simulation software. ATC Radar Simulation
     has integrated with CLIPS using multiprocessing techniques. Software development was done with
     C/C++/UNIX, X-WINDOWS and System V Interprocess Communication(IPC) facilities. 

     Florida Solar Energy Center, Cape Canaveral, Florida. 
     Research Assistant, Written Turbo PASCAL programs on PC and Dataplot programs on DEC VAX/VMS
     computer systems.

     Institute for Simulation and Training (IST), Orlando, Florida. 
     Research Associate, Written low level networking programs for Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS)
     protocol and Simulator Network (SIMNET) protocol. Projects included writing Protocol Conversion and
     Simulations programs. Software development was done using C/UNIX and System V IPC facilities on UNIX,
     and Microsoft C on PC.
