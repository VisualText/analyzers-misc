Objective
     Seeking a challenging position as a Software Engineer or Programmer.
Areas of interest include
     Multimedia software design, Image processing software design and
compression software design.

Education
     M.S., Electrical Engineering (EE), 9/95 - 12/96, GPA 3.6
     University of Southern California (USC), CA

     B. S., Electronic Engineering (EE), 9/91 - 6/95, GPA 3.4
     National Taiwan University, Taiwan R.O.C.

Experience

     Research Programmer, Digital Video Technologies, CA., 11/96 -
          As a staff in Research and Development Section. Doing research of
     Fractal video compression.

Class Projects

   * Research of Fractal video technology :
          Using Visual C++ in Win 95 to implement a Fractal image
     compression library including I/O functions and
          conversion between different image format(e.g. JPEG <-> Fractal).
     Then combining with audio compression
           library(ADPCM and GSM) to bulid a Video server and client
     application. Now we are dealing with 3-D Fractal
          and a faaster internet transmission protocol.
   * The Digital Image Processing Design :
          Using MATLAB and C language to design digital image processing
     filters or functions and algorithms of image
          compression like Huffman, Adaptive Arithmetic, Vector
     Quantization, DCT, Wavelet coding.
   * The Multimedia Title Development :
          Research topic is Fractal Image Compression. Implement a window
     application about Fractal Image
          Compression.
   * The VLSI Design :
          To implement some essential components like counter, adder,
     multiplier in MAGIC layout.

Skills
     High level language programming: C/C++, Visual C++ 4.0, Matlab,
Pascal, Visual Basic.
     Logic circuit design and layout: CAD Tools: Verilog, Magic, SPICE3,
IRSIM, Crystal

Courses
     Digital Image Processing I, II. Information Theorem, Multimedia Title
Development,
     Adaptive Digital Signal Processing, Random Process, Optical
Information Processing,
     VLSI System Design I, Computer System Architecture.
