                         Representative Experience

Sector7 Inc.  - August 1998 to present.
Operating System Migration Consultant - I provide technical consulting to
clients that are interested in converting their applications from VMS to
Unix or Windows NT. In the consulting process I conduct interviews with
developers and users at the client site and then review applications
components and code. The sales department is then presented with a project
plan and a budget estimate based on my analysis. I investigate the system
needs and recommend third party products and Sector7 services in my project
proposal. I also assist in project execution by programming C, C++, perl,
Korn shell and Windows NT scripting.

Effective Management Systems Solutions - July 1994 to August 1998
Programmer/Analyst - Position at EMS was project-oriented and required
various expertise.
NT Project Systems Developer. I ported our Unix enviroment to Windows NT. I
converted our Unix Korn shell scripts to perl, making the necessary changes
so they can run on Windows NT. I worked with data communications on a
Windows NT network. In August 1997 my department moved from our Milwaukee
headquarters to a new location a few miles away. I set up the local area
network using TCP/IP configuring Windows NT 4.0 servers as DNS and DHCP
servers. I provided access from our LAN to corporate headquarters by
setting up a NT 4.0 modem server. I then configured the PC clients to dial
up the corporate network with RAS, Remote Access Services, through the
modem server. Our department received a separate internet domain after the
our move. For my part of the internet project, I configured our router,
DSU, and T1 multiplexor in order to provide our location with web, ftp,
telnet, and email access to the internet.
UNIX project management. My first project was to lead the conversion of EMS
applications to the SCO UNIX environment. I wrote and modified Korn shell
and Perl scripts to manage our application's software environment. I
evaluated and implemented a SCO UNIX Windows NT gateway product for
in-house and customer use. Continuing duties include managing our in-house
UNIX/NT gateway, TCP/IP networking, recommending and testing third party
software and hardware, and provide consulting and support to our customer
base with a mixed UNIX and NT environment.
Technical products programmer.  Duties included creating and maintaining
warehouse and route accounting applications for Panasonic hand-held
computers written in C. Communication modules were also written in C and
used to upload and download data through serial ports, terminal servers and
remote modem transfers. I wrote host-side interfaces for our hand-held
applications and third-party coin-counting machines used in the vending
industry. Host communications were written for the VMS and UNIX
environments in the DBL programming language from Synergex. The necessity
of configuring remote terminal servers as network nodes for these and other
peripherals has increased my expertise in TCP/IP and DECnet. My last
project was to port our Panasonic warehouse and route accounting
applications to the Norand 6100, a DOS-based PDA, programmed in C++ and
PenRight. PenRight is a visual front end to C++ with libraries for a
pen-based interface.

Miller Compressing Company - August 1989 to July 1994.
Computer Programmer - December 1991 to July 1994. Position consisted of
developing stand-alone programs, subprograms, and copy-libraries to be
integrated into Miller Compressing's computer system. Also diagnosed user
complaints pertaining to in-house software and implemented solutions.
Programs were developed using COBOL 85 on a Hewlett Packard 3000, 900
series mainframe in a MPE XL operating system.
Computer Operation Supervisor - August 1989 to December 1991. Supervised
operations for a Hewlett Packard 3000, 900 series mainframe interfacing
with sixty terminals and twenty IBM compatible PCs and a Hewlett Packard
3000 micro. Responsible for installing terminals, PCs, data communication
equipment, printers and tape drives; managing a tape library; installing
PC-based programs; and writing MS-DOS batch files. Handled trouble-shooting
problems concerning data concentration devices for six remote locations.
Data transfer to closer remote sites were maintained via synchronous
statistical multiplexers and local dataset line drivers. Operations for a
distant remote site in Racine required extensive file transfer downloading
and uploading between PCs and mainframes requiring Kermit and Xmodem file
transfer protocols utilizing the programs Procomm, Reflection and Bitcom.

1986 to August 1989- Various positions in auditing and accounting at The
Palette Shop, Park East Hotel, Red Carpet Hotel, and Ramada Inn.
