# Miscelaneous Analyzers

Here you will find analyzers that are built by others that are either very specific and can be used as an example, or are old and are not the best way to write an analyzer with the more recent versions of NLP++

## Latex2Wiki

This analyzer was written by David de Hilster who was needing to convert Latex from conferernce papers in Overleaf.com to wiki for their wiki at http://wiki.naturalphilosophy.org

## Resume

This is a very old analyzer. So old in fact that NLP++ at the time did not have functions. This is there for inspiration and really would have to be rewritten. It does come with a test set as well as auto-generated rules.
