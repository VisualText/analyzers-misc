Latex2wiki
by David de Hilster

This analyzer takes latex and converts it to media wiki format (that from Wikipedia).

See the sample latex files in the input folder for references.

It was written to convert scientific papers writen on ShareLatex to wikipedia pages on http://wiki.naturalphilosophy.org
