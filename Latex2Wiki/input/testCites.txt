Observation of stellar movement of the  Milky  Way galaxy \cite{Milky way} shows that celestial objects at distance beyond 10 kpcs from the galactic center appear to move at speed higher than what Newtonian gravitational law \cite{Classic physics} predicts and that celestial objects in the inner range at distance between 1 and 8 kpcs from the center appear to move at speed lower than predicted  (Please refer to figure \ref{fig:galaxy-rotation-curve} in the main text). It appears to a group of people that this phenomenon is suggesting certain failure of the Newtonian gravitational law and that remedy to repair the failure is therefore needed.   They mainly propose two ideas as the remedy: (1) dark matter \cite{Dark Matter}, (2) to modify Newton's gravitational law \cite{Law modification}. 

To promote the acceptance of dark matter, it has been popularly advocated that the validity of relativity has enabled the dark matter to exist with unchallengeable legitimacy. A term called space-time fantasized out of relativity plays a key role for dark matter to enjoy a niche where verification never seems able to reach.    To reject the existence of dark matter, someone needs first to have relativity refuted.     It is so unfortunate to dark matter, however, relativity is exactly a theory that defeats itself, both in terms of mathematical derivation \cite{Rebigsol1-Relativity} as well as in terms of physical explanation \cite{Rebigsol2-Relativity} \cite{Rebigsol3-Relativity}.  Space-time as an independent fourth dimension in the universe does not exist, but space and time as two separate physical elements being absolute can be proven \cite{Rebigsol3-Relativity}. If relativity cannot even defend itself, it can only be obvious that it is unable to support the existence of dark matter.  Subsequently, the concept of dark matter is refutable.    

Finding no support from dark matter, this article can only go by the restricted application of the Newton's gravitational law in exploring the reason governing the speed distribution displayed in Fig. A. However, then, we must encounter the argument that Newton's law needs to be modified. But how? We will soon find that Newton's gravitational law can lead someone to have unlimited quantity of dark matter \textemdash if it is misapplied.    

Allowing Newton's gravitational law to be modified in the science world, we just end up placing ourselves to confront with a school principle that is as ancient as human beings ever have schools: Should a student taking a test be given the flexibility to modify a rule or law from a textbook only because he found this rule or law fails him from arriving at an answer at his satisfaction?  In the auditorium of science, we all are students of Mother Nature.  Never has she given us the privilege of arrogance with which we can claim that "I have no fault in study.  If no answer can be arrived at my satisfaction, it is the fault of the law that I am taught to follow." Nevertheless, Newton's laws in mechanics study are put up by great minds of many generations including those well respected pioneers like Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler...besides Newton.  It is for sure that we need to have an open mind toward all natural laws that are summarized by human. However, to anyone attempting the modification of a natural law that has been confirmed by numerous  practice, he must present the following two indispensable elements before so attempting: (1) miscalculation or mistreatment in the derivation of the law in concern is found, (2) some part of the derivation is found having been decisively misled by irrelevant facts, or inadequate facts, or improperly explained facts.  Plunging into modification without presenting these two gravely critical elements is only an excellent expression defining the word recklessness.  Frankly, no such attitude should be accepted in any serious business.     

This article presents several cases needing the scrutiny guided by Newtons gravitational law.  After the examination of these few cases, a reader can easily arrive at a conclusion regarding whether the science world has come to a need to modify Newton's law or a need to modify some people's attitude of attempting the modification of Newton's law.  Through applying Newton's law, it also appears to us that the Magellanic Clouds cannot be expected to have been traveling on a close orbit about the Milky Way, but instead, they are only one time visitors to our galaxy. No close orbit means no satellite. It therefore means that the Magellanic Clouds are of no satellite to the Milky Way.  Newton's gravitational law also gives us explanation why two-rotational-arms is a prominently popular phenomenon among rotating galaxies.
